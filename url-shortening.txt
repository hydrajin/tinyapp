Let's test what happens when we make a request to a shortened URL. A great tool for this sort of API testing is curl which we can use directly from our terminal.

Test that the redirect works.

In your terminal, enter the following command: curl -i http://localhost:8080/u/b2xVn2
Inspect the response from our server, what response code did we receive?
 HTTP response Status Code: 302 (Redirect)

Repeat the test, this time with the -L flag in the command: curl -L http://localhost:8080/u/b2xVn2
Inspect the response, what did we get back this time?
  ???
Head on over to the curl documentation, what's the difference between the -i and -L options?
-i or -head (Print the title without without the body of the document)

-L or --location (Follow curl redirect using HTTP location header)

Finally, lets test the http://localhost:8080/u/b2xVn2 url in our browser.
At this point we should see cURL and our browser make redirected GET requests to the longURL. We can now review our code and consider edge cases such as:

What would happen if a client requests a non-existent shortURL?

What happens to the urlDatabase when the server is restarted?

What type of status code do our redirects have? What does this status code mean?
